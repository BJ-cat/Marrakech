## Code Review

Reviewed by: Madison Wright

Reviewing code written by: Arnav Kaher 

Component: Task 6 code (implementing rollDie) & Task 4 (implementing isRugValid)

### Comments 

The good:
- Achieves purpose, passes test
- The best feature of the code is how straightforward it is
- Style and formatting consistent with Java conventions
- Names are clear and easy to understand (use camelCase)

What could be improved:
- Should add comments in the code to increase code clarity, explaining the logic of key steps
- For Task 4, could name "dice" to be more specific, e.g. "diceFaces"
- For Task 4, in terms of wider implementation, may be good to have a Dice class with this rollDie method in it
- For Task 6, add input validation to ensure "rug" and "gameString" are not null
